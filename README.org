* Pic midrange code
Helper functions for
- waiting
- LCD connection (HW setup inside)
- eeprom access
- Dallas interface

and demo for LCD printing and temperature measurement using Dallas
chip.
* Conventions
- INDF can be used by any procedure to store local data, but it is
  responsible for its callees to be able to do so as well.
- W is used for parameters passing, usually (what else?)
- I use several calls instead of 8x loops. It is shorter. Negative
  side is that stack depth needs to be taken into account
* GPsim needs to create eeprom file
